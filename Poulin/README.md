<h2> Summary </h2>

<p> Total number of events located: 12,663. Initial event detections taken from stacked amplitude envelope method of <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article/543218/induced-seismicity-characterization-during?casa_token=yArCmgQ71zcAAAAA:UXJD2MdzlhdUL5ne-4YOeuTvqB1ErPE0j6u0QSxSscg8X_ddWxPl50OUESPFCUn3MILZgKs"> Eaton et al., 2018 (SRL). </a> </p>

<p>  Correlations of equivalent marker reflections (horizons) that are clearly discernible and can be accurately picked in the P-P and P-S seismic volumes are used to build a (smoothed) lookup table for focal-time analysis that relates the tPSâˆ’tPP time difference to the tPP time. Microseismic processing involves applying a relative datum shift to the P- and S-wave time picks and the calculation of P- and S-wave move-outs, using linear regression analysis. Focal time of the event is then calculated using the interpolated lookup table and the P- and S-wave time picks, which are subsequently converted to depth based on synthetic well ties.  </p>
