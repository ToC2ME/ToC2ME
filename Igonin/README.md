<h2> Summary </h2>

<p> Total number of events located: 18,040. Initial event detections from match-filtering analysis of <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article/543218/induced-seismicity-characterization-during?casa_token=yArCmgQ71zcAAAAA:UXJD2MdzlhdUL5ne-4YOeuTvqB1ErPE0j6u0QSxSscg8X_ddWxPl50OUESPFCUn3MILZgKs"> Eaton et al., 2018 (SRL). </a> </p>

<p> Absolute locations based on P- and S-waveforms from 3C sensor. Method involves stacking waveforms along ray-tracing travel times within a volume. Includes all events that exceeded quality control criteria from a larger catalogue of detected events from multi-channel 3D cross-correlation. High resolution in x and y, but with a large uncertainty in depth. Method developed by <a href="https://www1.gly.bris.ac.uk/~gljpv/index.html"> Dr James Verdon</a> at the University of Bristol. Magnitudes obtained from 3C geophones using the standard <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/jb075i026p04997">Brune (1970)</a> formula. </p>
