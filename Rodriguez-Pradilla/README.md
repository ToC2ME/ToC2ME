<h2> Summary </h2>

<p> Total number of events detected: 10,691. </p>

<p> 17 high Signal-to-noise events (ML > 1.5) were chosen as template events for match filtering method for the automatic detection and phase picking of seismic events. P- and S-wave phase picks determined by an STA/LTA method using the squared amplitude of the recorded waveforms <a href="https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geophysics/article/81/2/KS71/293715/A-review-and-appraisal-of-arrival-time-picking">(Akram and Eaton, 2016)</a>. P- and S- wave picks were "cleaned" by removing picks that fall outside one standard deviation of the best-fitting Gaussian distributions for the template event. Epicentre location calculated using the noraml moveout equation. Focal depths obtained by finding the depth that minimizes the root-mean-square (RMS) of the traveltime residuals, based on a 1-D isotropic velocity model derived from nearby P- and S-wave sonic logs.  </p>
