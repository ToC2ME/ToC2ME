<h2> Running the code</h2>

<p> To execute, run the script LinEpiLoc_Main.m in MATLAB and select 
the script ending with "_SetInputFiles.m", that contains the Input 
Files with the receivers' coordinates, preliminary earthquake parameters, 
and the picked P- and S-wave arrival times (in seconds) for all the events. </p>

<p> This Demo for the ToC2ME dataset contains the four input files required
to execute the Script for epicentre location, listed in the script
"LinEpiLoc_ToC2ME_Demo_SetInputFiles.m": <br>
  
<ol>
  <li> Receivers' location from the Shallow-Borehole monitoring array <br>
   "NL" network code in IRIS database <br>
   Relative coordinates in metres <br>
   Input File: ToC2ME_Demo_recloc.txt </li>
  <li> Earthquakes' Source Parameters, with the Seg2 file name per seismic event, 
   and moment magnitude (Mw) <br>
   Input File: ToC2ME_Demo_sloc.txt </li>
  <li> Picked P-wave arrivals of all seismic events. <br>
   The stations without manual picking has "zero" in the input files. <br>
   Input File for P-wave picks: ToC2ME_Demo_PP_ReP.txt </li>
  <li> Picked S-wave arrivals of all seismic events. <br>
   The stations without manual picking has "zero" in the input files. <br>
   Input File for S-wave picks: ToC2ME_Demo_SP_ReP.txt </li>
</ol> 
   
<p> Once executed, the script exports a text file with the epicentre locations and 
focal time for all the seismic events that had manual picks for P- and/or S-wave
arrivals, and two figures of the implementation of the linearozed epicentre location
method on one event, and a map plot with the obtained epicentres and Mean coefficient
of determination (Mean R2) of the located events. </p>

<p> This script can also be implemented in any other surface seismic monitoring array 
by defining in separate .txt files the receivers location, preliminary source parameters, 
and picked P- and S-wave arrival times, in the same format as the four input files from the Demo, 
and then defining them in a new MATLAB script with its name ending with "_SetInputFiles.m". </p>
