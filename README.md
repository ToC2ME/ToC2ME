<h2> The ToC2ME Field Program </h2>

<p> The Tony Creek Dual Microseismic Experiment (ToC2ME) Field Porgram was a research-led project by the University of Calgary, in collaboration with a number of industry partners, investigating hydraulic fracturing within the Kaybob-Duvernay horizon in the Fox Creek area, Alberta. The ToC2ME acquisition system consisted of 69 cemented shallow boreholes, each with one three-component geophone at 27 m, and three one-component geophones at 22 m, 17 m and 12 m respectively (all OYO Geospace Seismic Recorder (GSX)-3 sensors with a sampling rate of 0.002 seconds). Furthermore, 6 boradband seismometers () and 1 strong-motion accelerometer were co-located to allow enhanced analysis of the recorded seismicity. These sensors continuously monitored a four-well hydraulic fracture experiment for ~40 days in late 2016. </p>

<p> The ToC2ME data set has been commercially processed by two independent companies, and is the focus of ongoing investigation by researchers at the University of Calgary and the University of Alberta. </p>
