The Tony Creek Dual Microseismic Experiment (ToC2ME) consists of monitoring a hydraulic fracturing completion just west of Fox Creek, Alberta, Canada in the Kaybob-Duvernay region.  This project was aquired and ran by the University of Calgary from October 25, 2015 to December 15, 2016 and recorded over 4000 events.  These events were recorded by a network of a 68 station shallow borehole array, 6 broadband seismometers, and 1 strong-motion accelerometer.  The main purpose of this project was to observe if there were any anomalous seismic events (Mw > 0), which had been previously recorded in the area.

Provided in the same folder as this README is a schematic image of the network used for ToC2ME.
