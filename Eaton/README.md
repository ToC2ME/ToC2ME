<h2> Summary </h2>

<p> Total number of events detected: 4083. </p>

<p> Event detection using a threshold based stack of the amplitude-envelope for the 3C geophone traces. From this, 15 candidate events with high signal-to-noise were used as templates in a match-filtering algorithm after <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/206/1/644/2606547"> Caffagni et al., 2016</a>. Hypocenter locations determined using a layered 1D blocked P-wave velocity model using data from a nearby sonic-log via a modified direct global search method (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Curtis2/publication/27774082_Earthquake_Location_Direct_Global-Search/links/02e7e52c840078db52000000.pdf">Lomax et al., 2014</a>). 
Relative locations of all event detected using the match filter approach were determined from their template event. Seismic moment magnitudes for all events were estimated by fitting the low‐frequency plateau of the S‐wave displacement spectrum based on the model by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/jb075i026p04997">Brune, 1970</a>. </p>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
  <li> Locations are given within a reference frame, rather than as absolute co-ordinates, with the reference being the minimum of the receiver locations. </li>
  <li> There are a number of know duplicate events within this catalog, which can be removed if necessary. </li>
  <li> A number of events from this catalog were used in the work of Poulin et al. (see <a href="https://github.com/ToC2ME/ToC2ME/tree/master/Poulin"> Poulin</a> on this site). </li>
