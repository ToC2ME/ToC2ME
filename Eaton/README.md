<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
  <li> Duplicate events that were originally in the January 2018 catalog have been deleted and their
	   counterparts are highlighted in blue in the spreadsheet. </li>
  <li> Events from January 2018 catalog that had their depths relocated using the 3D seismic
	   converted waves method (see work by  <a href="https://github.com/ToC2ME/ToC2ME/tree/master/poulin"> Poulin</a> on this site) are highlighted in yellow. </li>
